# Hexadecimal color values are also supported in all browsers.

# A hexadecimal color is specified with: #RRGGBB!

# RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) are hexadecimal integers between 00 and FF specifying the intensity of the color.

# For example, #0000FF is displayed as blue, because the blue component is set to its highest value (FF) and the others are set to 00.
